Since its beginnings in 1984, it has grown from a small gathering of musicians into an international event that attracts thousands of people each year. More than a music festival, it is a space where tradition and modernity come together, where Cape Verdean identity is celebrated alongside global influences. Its location—under the full moon on the beach of Baía das Gatas—symbolizes harmony between nature, art, and community. The festival highlights the power of music to unite people, strengthen cultural pride, and promote Cape Verde to the world.">Learn more</a>

More than simple showcases, each exhibition reflects the institution’s mission to train artists who combine technique, creativity, and social awareness. The works often address themes connected to Cape Verdean identity, insularity, and global transformations, presenting art as a bridge between the local and the universal. The academic environment encourages innovation, allowing young creators to explore new visual languages while engaging with the cultural heritage of the archipelago. In this way, M_EIA’s exhibitions strengthen Mindelo’s position as a center of critical reflection and artistic expression, where art is not only contemplated but lived as an essential part of social and cultural development.">Learn more</a>

                       data-text="Traditional dance and theater are vital expressions of cultural memory and community identity. Through rhythm, movement, and storytelling, they preserve values, history, and collective experiences that might otherwise be forgotten. In Cape Verde, dance often embodies the spirit of celebration and resilience, while theater reflects daily struggles, humor, and wisdom passed down through generations. Both art forms create spaces where people connect—not only as performers and spectators, but as participants in a shared heritage. At the same time, traditional dance and theater continue to evolve, embracing contemporary influences while remaining deeply rooted in cultural traditions. They remind us that art is not just entertainment, but a living dialogue between the past and the present, capable of inspiring pride, unity, and reflection within society.">Learn more</a>
